# Printing Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to print the parts for the Microban robot. It covers recommended settings, orientations, and tips to ensure successful prints. To see the full assembly of the parts, you can refer to the [Onshape assembly](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d424992a192a8ce34ffce163/v/7de3e6e40f0e1185d169e6d9/e/b34620a03cc3a684006c5867?renderMode=0&uiState=6a2fccab8e6d9214d2644ca7).


## Recommended Settings

The parts are available in the `cad/stl/` directory of this repository, and they are designed to be printed using a standard desktop 3D printer with PETG-CF (carbon-fiber-filled PETG) filament, 0.12mm layer height, and 100% infill. PETG-CF is abrasive, so use a hardened steel (or similarly wear-resistant) nozzle rather than plain brass. The next table summarizes the number of parts to print for each component of the robot. Please note that some parts may require specific orientations for printing, please refer to the [Part Orientation](#part-orientation) section for more details.

## Part Orientation 

The parts that support the plain bearings (POM washers sandwiched between steel shims) should be printed in a specific orientation to ensure proper fit and surface finish. These orientations can increase the required support material, but they are necessary to ensure that the bearings fit correctly and that the parts function as intended. These parts are: 
- `hip.stl`
- `pelvis.stl`  
- `arm_bearing_support.stl`
- `shoulder.stl`

The following parts also require specific orientations to ensure proper fit and alignment with the motors:
- `idle_horn.stl`
- `idle_cap.stl`
- `radius.stl`

The following images show the recommended orientations for the parts listed above.

For all the other parts, the orientation is quite straightforward, and they can be printed without the need of support material for a lot of them.


---

Once you have all the parts, if you already purchased the necessary components listed in the [BOM](bom.md), you can proceed to assemble the robot by following the [Assembly Guide](assembly.md).
