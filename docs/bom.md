# Bill of Materials (BOM)

Here is a detailed Bill of Materials (BOM) for the project, including links to purchase each component and their approximate prices. Please note that prices may vary based on location and availability. You can source the components from your preferred suppliers, but beware that for electronic components using cheaper distributors may result in lower quality and reliability. 

Unlike the other components, the **[RPI Robot Hat](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/elec_RPI_Robot_HAT)** is not an off-the-shelf part: it is an open-source board that you need to have manufactured. Its design files are freely available on GitHub and can be ordered from any PCB fabrication service (e.g. JLCPCB, PCBWay, Aisler). The listed price is a rough estimate and will depend on the fab you choose and the quantity ordered. 

At the time of writing, **a Microban robot costs approximately $2,090** with this configuration (XC330-T288-T servos, 3S battery pack, and the added stereo camera -- the camera price is an estimate pending a firm quote from the supplier).

If you also include the configuration tools (Dynamixel U2D2 and U2D2 Power Hub), the total cost rises to approximately $2,145.

> [!WARNING]
> **Note regarding PCB Ordering with JLCPCB**
> 
> The default R33 resistor might currently be out of stock at JLCPCB, so double-check its presence during the preview step. If the default R33 is on shortage, you can easily swap it with another 150R 0402 resistor (e.g., part numbers `RT0402BRD07150RL` or `RCA02150RJLF`).

Any standard should work. |

**Important Note:** The total number of M2x6 screws contained in 21 motor kits is 126, while the number of M2x6 screws required for the assembly is still 124 (the 2 new neck roll/pitch joints use M2.5 screws, not the standard horn M2x6, so this requirement is unchanged from the original 19-servo design -- worth double-checking once you have built the neck). With 21 motors you therefore already have a couple of spare M2x6 screws. I still personally recommend buying some additional M2x6 screws to avoid any issues during assembly. I also recommend buying M2.2x8 for the motor fixation, as the M2x8 screws provided with the motors may not fit perfectly, although they are usable. Check the [Optional Components](#optional-components) section for more details.


## Configuration Tools

In addition to the components that make up the robot, you will also need configuration tools to set up the Dynamixel motors:

| Component | Quantity | Price | Link | Description / Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Dynamixel U2D2 | 1 | $32.10 | [Robotis](https://en.robotis.com/shop_en/item.php?it_id=902-0132-000) | USB to Dynamixel adapter for motor configuration. |
| Dynamixel U2D2 Power Hub | 1 | $19.00 | [Robotis](https://en.robotis.com/shop_en/item.php?it_id=902-0145-001) | Power hub for U2D2. |
| 5V DC Power Supply | 1 | ~$5.00 | [AliExpress](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005006681380264.html?src=google&src=google&albch=shopping&acnt=248-630-5778&isdl=y&slnk=&plac=&mtctp=&albbt=Google_7_shopping&aff_platform=google&aff_short_key=UneMJZVf&gclsrc=aw.ds&albagn=888888&ds_e_adid=&ds_e_matchtype=&ds_e_device=c&ds_e_network=x&ds_e_product_group_id=&ds_e_product_id=fr1005006681380264&ds_e_product_merchant_id=109233876&ds_e_product_country=FR&ds_e_product_language=fr&ds_e_product_channel=online&ds_e_product_store_id=&ds_url_v=2&albcp=19000710609&albag=&isSmbAutoCall=false&needSmbHouyi=false&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=17725339642&gbraid=0AAAAACWaBweuoiaNc4XiSTkGHPjyMW6GD&gclid=Cj0KCQjwrs7RBhDuARIsAIVfBD0W5aMl1lU2v3nhWRxGFVcibpgHUv8IFQLeOQACU-XE4MzK3mm_oPoaArMQEALw_wcB) | 5V DC power supply for U2D2 Power Hub. Does not require a lot of current, it is only needed for the initial configuration. |

In case of building several robots, it is not necessary to buy several U2D2 sets, as they are only required for the initial configuration of the motors. 


## Optional Components

As discussed in the [Robot Components](#robot-components) section, I personally recommend replacing the provided M2x8 screws by M2.2x8 screws. For your information, the total amount of M2x6 self-tapping screws required for the assembly is 124, they are used to fix the horns to the parts. The total amount of M2x8 / M2.2x8 self-tapping screws required for the assembly is 66, they are used to fix the motors to the parts. Having extra screws can also be useful in case of loss.

The number of cables provided with the motors should be sufficient for the robot, but you may need additional cables in case of damage. 
It is also preferable to adjust the cable lengths to the minimum required for the robot to avoid cable entanglement. It is possible to only use off-the-shelf cables of size 50mm (6), 100mm (4), and 180mm (9), but due to the lack of availability, it is preferable to crimp your own cables. To do so, you can buy SEH-001T-P0.6 crimp pins and adjust 180mm cables to the required lengths. Detailed instructions on how to crimp your own cables will be provided in the Assembly Guide.

Finally, if you plan to use Microban intensively, you may want to consider having additional batteries and a charger to avoid downtime during charging. 

For all these reasons, here are some optional components you may want to consider:

Once you have all the components, you can proceed to print the parts. Follow the [Printing Guide](printing.md) for detailed instructions.

If you already have the parts printed and the components purchased, you can directly proceed to the assembly of the robot by following the [Assembly Guide](assembly.md).
