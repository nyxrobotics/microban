Welcome to the **Microban** project! 

Microban is a ~30cm tall open-source humanoid robot created by [Marc Duclusaud](https://github.com/MarcDcls) as a member of the Rhoban team at LaBRI, University of Bordeaux, and designed specifically for makers, students, and robotics enthusiasts. The core philosophy behind this project is accessibility: the total cost of the robot is kept relatively low ($550-$600), all components are 3D-printable or easily sourced, and the assembly process is guided with detailed instructions. This means that anyone with a standard desktop 3D printer and a few basic tools should be able to build their own Microban from scratch.

The idea behind Microban is to provide a platform for learning and experimentation in robotics. By making the design open, users are encouraged to modify, improve, and share their own versions of the robot. Whether you're interested in programming, mechanical design, or electronics, Microban offers a hands-on experience that can help you develop your skills in a fun and engaging way.

The main features of Microban are:
*   🤖 **100% Open-Design**: Mechanics, 3D models, and documentation are entirely free to use and modify.
*   🔧 **DIY & Maker Friendly**: Guided assembly instructions, fully 3D-printable parts and cheap components.
*   📏 **Compact Size**: Microban is only 30cm tall and can be recharged via USB-C, making it the perfect desktop companion for robotics experimentation.

## 📁 CAD Files

<img height="350px" alt="Capture d’écran du 2026-06-15 13-33-16" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8dab3c1c-3dc4-4dd1-9fc4-ea44fbaea734" align="right"/>

The CAD files for Microban are in the `cad/` directory of this repository. It contains all the printable parts in both STL and STEP formats.

A visual representation of the 3D model can be found in the [Onshape assembly](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d424992a192a8ce34ffce163/v/7de3e6e40f0e1185d169e6d9/e/b34620a03cc3a684006c5867?renderMode=0&uiState=6a2fccab8e6d9214d2644ca7). This interactive assembly allows you to explore the robot's design in detail, providing a better understanding of how the parts fit together. It also serves as a reference for assembly, helping you visualize the final product and ensuring that you can correctly identify each component during the build process.

An emphasis is placed on the range of motion of the 21 degrees of freedom of the robot, which now include a 2-DOF (roll + pitch) neck carrying a forward-facing stereo camera. It allows for a wide variety of movements, making it suitable for various applications. Stops are integrated into the design to control which self-collisions are likely to occur, ensuring that the robot can move safely without damaging itself. The design also takes into account the cable routing for the servo motors, ensuring that the wires are neatly organized and do not interfere with the robot's movements.

## 🚀 Getting Started 

> **Need help during the build?** 
> If you run into any issues while sourcing components, printing parts, or assembling your Microban, don't hesitate to ask the community in the **[Q&A Discussions section](https://github.com/Rhoban/microban/discussions/categories/q-a)**!

To build your own Microban, you will need to follow these steps:

1. **Source the hardware:** Gather the components listed in the [BOM](docs/bom.md). Links are provided to purchase each item, but feel free to source them from your preferred suppliers. Some components, like the Dynamixel motors, may have specific distributors depending on your location, which can impact the total cost. 

2. **Print the parts:** Head over to the `cad/stl/` folder and print all the parts using a 3D printer. The recommended filament is PETG-CF (carbon-fiber-filled PETG) with a layer height of 0.12mm and 100% infill. PETG-CF is abrasive, so print with a hardened steel (or similarly wear-resistant) nozzle rather than plain brass. Some parts require specific orientations for printing to ensure strength and proper fit. Refer to the [Printing Guide](docs/printing.md) for detailed instructions on how to print each part correctly.

3. **Assemble:** Follow our step-by-step [Assembly Guide](docs/assembly.md) to put the mechanics together.

4. **Deploy the software:** Once the robot is assembled, you can deploy the software on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W by following the instructions in the [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment.md). 

5. **Drive it:** See the [Usage Guide](docs/usage.md) to run the robot, control it with the keyboard or a gamepad, and learn how to add your own moves.
